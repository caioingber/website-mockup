## Responsive Web Page Project

This initial project serves to test my initial skills is utilizing a designer layout to build a responsive web page utilizing HTML & CSS.

I hope to replicate the layout as closely as possible to that in the design file. Please reference black-light-aquarium.xd for the original layout.

#### Design

I used a combination of flexbox and grid displays within my the body's individual divisions.
What I found to be most difficult was the position of the top image as it crossed over different div's.
