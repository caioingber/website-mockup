# Website Mockup - Black Light Aquarium

This initial project serves to test my initial skills is utilizing a designer layout to build a responsive web page utilizing HTML & CSS.

I hope to replicate the layout as closely as possible to that in the design file. Please reference black-light-aquarium.xd for the original layout.

## Design

I used a combination of flexbox and grid displays within my the body's individual divisions.
What I found to be most difficult was the position of the top image as it crossed over different div's.

## Unsolved Problems

There are portions of the mobile responsive site that need to be tidied up. As this was my first full foray into building a static website, I would also like to make the CSS cleaner and more efficient, as the stylings do not adhere to DRY principles.
